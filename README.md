## TSCO-Application

TSCO Application is an inventory control application that replaces the need of multiple excel files for keeping track of 
vendor specific inventory control. The application was initially written for Tube Specialties Company to better serve 
their needs of training new hires within the department, to provide access to all the data from one simple location and to be 
able to search all the data for a particular item. The application was never used within the organization due to the project
taking several months for implementation and the extreme lack of interest for the application by management. The application 
was developed after working hours as a personal project with the intention of production use but overall the objective was 
to enhance my knowledge of programming in Java.
